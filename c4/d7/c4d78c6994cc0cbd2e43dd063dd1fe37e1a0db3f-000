#
# <bottle> is the CrossOver bottle the game runs in, e.g.
#   ~/Library/Application Support/CrossOver/Bottles/Steam
#
# NOTHING IN THE GAME FOLDER IS TOUCHED. Four DLLs are placed in the bottle's
# system32 and activated for this one executable through AppDefaults, so no
# other title in the same bottle changes behaviour. A global d3d9 override would
# silently alter every other D3D9 game; that is why this is per-application.
#
# WHAT THIS FIXES.
#
# Razor's Edge is the odd one of the Master Collection: Direct3D 9 only, where
# SIGMA and SIGMA 2 are D3D11 and start fine. Under CrossOver's own DXVK it
# refuses to start with "Insufficient VRAM. Please close all running
# applications." -- which is a red herring. Its log says what really happened,
# eleven times over: DxvkAdapter: Failed to create device, after reporting
# transformFeedback and timelineSemaphore as 0. MoltenVK does not offer those
# and that DXVK build requires them. Two lines earlier the same log reports the
# machine's full 48 GB, so memory was never the problem.
#
# Its 24 movies are ASF containers with WMV3 video and WMA v2 audio, played
# through DirectShow -- quartz and qasf -- not through Media Foundation. An
# afternoon went into instrumenting MFTEnumEx and the source readers, all of
# which correctly reported nothing, because nothing was there.
#
# WHERE THE BINARIES COME FROM.
#
# Three of the four are other people's work and ship beside this script, so the
# fix does not depend on the user having installed anything else first:
#
#   d3d9.dll          d9vk, Sikarugir-App/d9vk, v1.10.3-20250511 (macOS async)
#   qasf.dll          winevideo's patched DirectShow ASF Reader
#   quartz.dll        winevideo's patched filter graph
#   winegstreamer.dll winevideo's patched PE half
#
# d9vk is DXVK, zlib-licensed. qasf, quartz and winegstreamer are Wine, LGPL --
# patched builds by winevideo's author, whose diagnosis and implementation the
# whole fix rests on. Both licences permit redistribution; both require the
# licence text to travel with the binaries, which is why licences/ is beside
# them in the bundle.
#
# The qasf change is the substantial one and it is not a codec matter: Wine's
# ASF Reader delivered a video sample on the WMReader callback, the downstream
# video pin blocked in Receive(), and audio -- which needs the same callback to
# preroll -- never got its turn, so the graph sat in VFW_S_STATE_INTERMEDIATE
# instead of reaching Running. winevideo's build moves blocking video delivery
# onto a serialized worker so audio can preroll. Credit for the diagnosis and
# the implementation belongs to winevideo's author, not to this project.
#
# KNOWN LIMIT. The boot movie decodes its first frame and freezes; one click
# skips it and the game carries on. In-game cutscenes play. winevideo 0.5 runs
# the boot movie too, because there all four pieces are one coherent build --
# here winegstreamer's PE half sits on this engine's Unix half, and only the PE
# half can be overridden per application.
#
# MGVF-SCOPE: bottle
# MGVF-GAME: NINJA GAIDEN 3: Razor's Edge | NINJA GAIDEN 3 Razor's Edge.exe |
# MGVF-WHY: Will not start at all: "Insufficient VRAM. Please close all running applications." It is a Direct3D 9 title and CrossOver's DXVK cannot create a Vulkan device for it. Needs d9vk plus winevideo's DirectShow filters, applied to this executable only.
