# This one is different from the other nine, in two ways worth knowing before
# running it.
#
# THE CARRIER IS NOT THE GAME'S. NieR ships exactly one DLL of its own,
# steam_api64.dll, and nothing here rides on Steam's API or re-exports a
# Steamworks entry point. So the bridge rides on dinput8.dll, which the game
# imports and which has five exports and nothing to do with rendering. The
# original is CrossOver's own: this script copies it out of your bottle and
# beside the game as dinput8_real.dll. Nothing is redistributed -- the copy is
# your file -- but it is a copy, so re-run this after a CrossOver upgrade if
# input ever misbehaves.
#
# IT WRITES ONE REGISTRY KEY. Wine implements dinput8 itself and prefers its
# own build, so a DLL sitting beside the game is never loaded. The override
# below says otherwise, and is scoped to this executable alone: no other title
# in the bottle sees it. --restore removes it.

#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT IS FOR, in a form something other than a human can read.
#
# One MGVF-GAME line per title this installer serves -- four of them serve more
# than one, which the manifest could not express before. The fields are the
# game's name, its shipping executable, and where the carrier sits relative to
# the game folder (empty means the folder itself). The executable is the
# identity: there is no AppID anywhere in this project, and the folder name is
# Valve's to choose -- Mortal Shell 2 installs into one called Sparta.
#
# runtime/check-builds.sh checks these against the app's own table, so the two
# copies cannot drift apart in silence.
#
# MGVF-SCOPE: folder
# MGVF-GAME: NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139 | NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139.exe | 
# MGVF-WHY: Crashes when the first video starts. Its video is WMV2 with WMA v2 audio in ASF, and CrossOver demuxes ASF while decoding neither stream, so the staged decoder is needed too.

# a key present in one of them gave it away. Writing an override that way puts
# it in a bottle the user never plays in, and says nothing.
#
