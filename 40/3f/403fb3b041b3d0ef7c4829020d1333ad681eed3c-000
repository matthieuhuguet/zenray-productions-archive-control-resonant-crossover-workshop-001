#
# Give it the package folder -- the one Steam installed, holding those
# executables. It works out which are there.
#
# 0.2 Birth by Sleep ships inside 2.8 and is not in the list: its cutscenes are
# software MPEG-1 through CriWare, they already play, and this does nothing for
# them. KINGDOM HEARTS III is the same case and is not supported here either.
#
# THE CARRIER IS NOT THE GAME'S. The only DLL beside these executables is
# steam_api64.dll, and nothing here rides on Steam's API or re-exports a
# Steamworks entry point. So the bridge rides on dinput8.dll, which every one of
# them imports and which has five exports and nothing to do with rendering. The
# original is CrossOver's own: this script copies it out of your bottle and
# beside the game as dinput8_real.dll. Nothing is redistributed -- the copy is
# your file -- but it is a copy, so re-run this after a CrossOver upgrade if
# input ever misbehaves.
#
# IT WRITES ONE REGISTRY KEY PER EXECUTABLE. Wine implements dinput8 itself and
# prefers its own build, so a DLL sitting beside the game is never loaded. The
# override says otherwise, and is scoped to those executables alone: no other
# title in the bottle sees it. --restore removes them.
#
# SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT IS FOR, in a form something other than a human can read.
#
# One MGVF-GAME line per title this installer serves -- four of them serve more
# than one, which the manifest could not express before. The fields are the
# game's name, its shipping executable, and where the carrier sits relative to
# the game folder (empty means the folder itself). The executable is the
# identity: there is no AppID anywhere in this project, and the folder name is
# Valve's to choose -- Mortal Shell 2 installs into one called Sparta.
#
# runtime/check-builds.sh checks these against the app's own table, so the two
# copies cannot drift apart in silence.
#
# MGVF-SCOPE: folder
# MGVF-GAME: KINGDOM HEARTS Dream Drop Distance | KINGDOM HEARTS Dream Drop Distance.exe | 
# MGVF-GAME: KINGDOM HEARTS HD 1.5+2.5 ReMIX | KINGDOM HEARTS HD 1.5+2.5 Launcher.exe | 
# MGVF-WHY: Cutscenes run with sound and a solid green picture: the luma and chroma planes never reach the game's own textures. The same DLL also swallows the shutdown fault that makes Wine open a crash dialog when a launcher or a title closes, so one install fixes both.

# a key present in one of them gave it away. Writing an override that way puts
# it in a bottle the user never plays in, and says nothing.
