# WHAT THIS IS. An improvement, not a fix. No title in the table needs it and
# every one of them runs without it; it is offered so that a controller on
# Bluetooth works the way it does over USB. A DualSense on Bluetooth wants
# output report 0x31 with a CRC, and no Windows client under wine ever sends
# one, because every one of them decides USB against Bluetooth the same way:
# hidapi asks the HID device's parent devnode for its compatible ids and looks
# for BTHENUM. Under wine CM_Get_Parent was a stub and winebus named no bus at
# all, so the answer was always "not Bluetooth" -- Steam's log says
# "bluetooth 0" for a pad that is -- and every client that asks that way then
# built the wrong report, which the pad ignores in silence. Which is why the
# symptom was never a flat "no rumble" but a lottery: a title that writes the
# pad's own report by some other route rumbles, one that trusts the bus answer
# does not. With the files
# here the answer is the true one: rumble, the PS button and the touchpad
# work over Bluetooth, measured on 2026-09-08; trigger effects ride in the same
# report, and the owner reports them in a title that sends them.
#
# The fourth file, winebus.so, is the unix half, and it is here for a different
# fault: macOS drives a connected DualSense itself and writes Bluetooth output
# reports to it, wine opened the same pad shared and wrote its own, and macOS's
# writes then time out. Measured from macOS's own log on 2026-09-08, where link
# drops followed; that the contention caused them, and that the seize prevents
# them, was never measured. So wine SEIZED a DualSense that arrived over
# Bluetooth, which cost what it says: while a bottle held the pad, macOS and its
# own applications could not use it, and macOS's own 900 s idle disconnect was
# starved of input and cut the pad in the middle of a game. Since mgvf-0034 the
# pad is SHARED by default, measured over three sessions and a day without a
# drop during play, and a registry value asks for the seize per device --
# see runtime/engine-payload-controller/README.md.
#
# Same shape as install-engine-media.sh, same rules: it writes into the ENGINE,
# which every bottle and every game on it shares, so it refuses an engine these
# were not built for -- name AND version, because a patched fork and stock
# CrossOver report the same version -- keeps the original beside each file as
# .mgvf-stock, never lets a backup be our own build, and replaces by rename so a
# process holding the old file keeps the old file. Four files, built from the
# engine's own wine source with mgvf-0002, mgvf-0003, mgvf-0004, mgvf-0005 and
# mgvf-0006 on top, and --restore puts CodeWeavers' four back. THREE of them
# are PE and live in lib/wine/x86_64-windows/; the fourth is the unix half of
# winebus and lives in lib/wine/x86_64-unix/, a different directory, which is
# the one thing about this set that cannot be guessed from the other three.
#
# It signs. The media installer leaves signing to make-engine-copy.sh, which
# runs it partway through and signs at its last step. This one is turned on and
# off after the copy exists, with nothing after it, so it re-signs the bundle
# itself and clears the quarantine attribute, in that order.
