# Install (or remove) the startup fix for RESONANCE: A PLAGUE TALE LEGACY.
#
# Nothing the game ships is edited. One DLL is renamed and one is added:
#
#   NvCloth_x64.dll       <- our proxy, forwards all 42 symbols to the original
#   NvCloth_x64_real.dll  <- the game's own, untouched
#
#   install-resonance-fix.sh <game folder>            install
#   install-resonance-fix.sh <game folder> --restore  remove
#   install-resonance-fix.sh <game folder> --status   report what is in place
#
# <game folder> is the one holding Resonance.exe, e.g.
#   .../steamapps/common/Resonance A Plague Tale Legacy
#
# WHAT THIS FIXES.
#
# The title refuses to start where the device reports Shader Model 6.6:
#
#     Fatal error
#     Shader Model 6.7 is not supported by this device!
#     Maximum Shader Model supported is 6.6
#
# One comparison, cmp eax, 67h, and everything either side of it is correct --
# D3DMetal has 6.6 because it has 6.6, and the game's own store page asks for
# 6.6. The byte becomes 66h in memory and the check passes. Nothing on disk is
# touched, so a Steam verification does not undo it and an update does not fight
# it. Found by pattern, not by address: the offsets that circulate are per-build
# and were already wrong for the copy this was written against.
#
# What it costs is known: some puzzle textures and effects are missing, because
# the title does have 6.7 paths and this keeps it off them. The rest plays.
#
# AND ONE THING THIS CANNOT FIX, which you have to do yourself.
#
# IT STARTS TO A BLACK SCREEN ON AN HDR DISPLAY, and that is a setting rather
# than a monitor. On a display it reads as HDR the title turns HDR10 on by
# itself -- nobody sets it -- and then renders four hundred draws a frame into a
# window that stays black. Menu, cutscenes, everything.
#
# Set `HDR10 0` in its ENGINESETTINGS file and it starts and draws at the
# desktop resolution.
#
# THIS PARAGRAPH USED TO SAY THE DISPLAY HAD TO BE 16:9, and that was wrong.
# The retraction is kept rather than deleted, because the reasoning that led
# there was sound and somebody will arrive at it again: on a 3456x2234 panel the
# black screen is real, 1920x1080 does cure it, and the aspect ratio is the
# obvious difference. It is not the cause. Changing resolution changed which
# display mode was picked and took HDR with it. The wiki page carries the
# measurement that separated them, on 2026-09-03.
#
# AND THE VIDEOS, which are not a video problem.
#
# The logo and tutorial MP4s never appear, at any resolution, and it is worth
# saying plainly that nothing in this project can fix that. They are H.264 High
# in MP4 with AAC -- the most ordinary file there is -- and the whole path works:
#
#     MediaEngineClassFactory::CreateInstance -> 0x00000000
#     OnVideoStreamTick: asked 1200 times, a frame was ready 428 of them
#     TransferVideoFrame -> ok (360 so far)      0 failures
#
# The title plays them through IMFMediaEngine, created over COM -- which is why
# nothing here saw them for an afternoon: it never calls MFTEnumEx and never
# creates a source reader, so the five entry points this probe swapped were the
# wrong five. Underneath, mfmp4srcsnk demuxes and winegstreamer decodes, both
# measured present and both working.
#
# Then the frames are handed to a texture of the game's own and never drawn.
# Confirmed by filling the surrounds of every transferred frame with opaque
# magenta: three hundred and sixty frames delivered, forty percent of the
# surface painted a colour the game does not contain, and the screen stayed
# black. That surface does not reach the screen, and what happens to it after
# TransferVideoFrame is inside the engine, not inside anything we can hook.
#
# Ruled out along the way, so nobody repeats it: MetalFX and its temporal
# scaling, the Metal 4 backend, the video memory budget (the adapter reports 76
# GB; the zero in the game's own crash report is its own number), D3D11 against
# D3D12, Game Porting Toolkit 3.0 against 4.0b2, and patching the executable on
# disk exactly as the community fix says -- which is equivalent to this and just
# as black while the title has HDR10 on.
#
# MGVF-SCOPE: folder
# MGVF-GAME: RESONANCE: A PLAGUE TALE LEGACY | Resonance.exe |
# MGVF-WHY: Refuses to start: "Shader Model 6.7 is not supported by this device". It also turns HDR10 on by itself on a display it reads as HDR and starts to a black screen, so HDR10 0 goes into its ENGINESETTINGS file.
